# Solar System Navigator

A lightweight Rust application for planning and browsing celestial trajectories throughout our solar system. Leveraging the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine, _Solar System Navigator_ renders interactive orbital simulations that help you visualize and refine spacecraft paths across various planetary bodies.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**  
  Watch orbits update smoothly in a user-friendly 3D environment.
  
- **Configurable Trajectories**  
  Adjust orbital parameters and craft flight paths with minimal effort.
  
- **High-Level Abstractions**  
  Manage calculations and space mechanics with straightforward Rust data structures.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-system-navigator.git
   ```
   
2. Install Rust & Cargo:  
   Make sure you have Rust (and its package manager, Cargo) installed.  
   [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

3. Build and run:  
   ```bash
   cd solar-system-navigator
   cargo run
   ```

## Roadmap

- **Navigation**  
  - Use your mouse and keyboard to zoom, pan, and rotate the viewpoint.
  - Observe planetary bodies and probe trajectories as the simulation runs.

- **Editing Trajectories**  
  - Tweak orbital or spacecraft parameters in the code or configuration files.
  - Re-run the project to see updated paths.

- **Add Your Own Bodies**  
  - Extend the simulation by adding extra planetary or spacecraft data.

- **In-Sim Editing**  
  - On-the-fly parameter adjustments for instant feedback.

- **Trajectory Explorer**  
  - Start with real trajectories of missions like Apollo 11 and Osiris-REX
